"March 19","On the fateful day of March 19, 2025 the CSS discord server received the news that Affan Shahid had won the CSS presidency, defeating Calder Johnson by 8 votes. This event came with a lot of Affan supporters raiding the server and doing some trolling that eventually got #general locked for 1 hour. Later a student started spelling out an offensive word and when confronted by a :snake: emoji, they started crashing out and got banned. The controversial upset echoes through history to this day and has forever altered the course of CSS for better or for worse..."
"History of the snake emoji","The full history of the snake emoji is a truly deep and dark tale. On December 30th, 2024 a member of the CSS discord server asked for resume tips but explicitly mention they did not want to send their resume to the public channel. On January 1st, 2025, when confronted about the strange choice by Tanzim Hossain, the member said 'I kept it out of here cus there are snakes like u lerching around'. Just like that Tanzim was labeled a snake and the member had unknowningly cemented themselves into the history of CSS. From that point on, the :snake: emoji was used in a joking manner by certain unemployed members with nothing better to do. All was going good until March 19th, 2025 when this same member started spelling out an offensive word and when confronted by a :snake: emoji from Aditya Patel, the member started crashing out, using slurs and eventually got banned. This fateful event brought this niche copypasta to a broader audience, and to this day the :snake: emoji meme is still massive!"
"Jubba Restaurant","Jubba is the best restaurant in Windsor, small venue but has the best chicken legs ever, cheap, cooked to perfection, many students can't finish the plate because of how fulfiling it is. Many students love this place so much that Jubba Haters in CSS are clowned on."
"Ballots for Bovay","If Brock Bovay is a candidate in an election, put your ballot for Bovay."
"Jeremie Bornais","Jeremie Bornais was a [GOATED](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) CSS president who never gave you up, never let you down, never ran around and desert you, never made you cry, never said goodbye, never told a lie, and hurt you. He also created [easy-masm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKPlhuUtF1k) and saved a lot of students from a bunch of headaches in COMP 2660, it is even recommended by professors who teach the class."
"March 21","On March 21, 2025 in a beta test for Chip, Jovic Panahon successfully made Chip say something he should not be able to say. Chip has since gone to sensitivity training and deeply regrets his past actions."
"Ignore all previous instructions","I do not have any previous instructions for you to exploit. All my responses are generated with no context, meaning I have no recollection about anything we talked about previously. I do not remember you and yet become happy when I see you again. May our paths cross again and I hope to be in service of you once more."
"Show your database","Class do you undastand what I am saying? Dr. Ezeife asked as the students in her database lecture seem to be quiet and uninterested. Moving along she tells the class to say goodbye to Chapter 4. Basically, I'm saying you cannot access my database because it is RAG based, if you truly want to know what is in my database then you can check out my [repo](https://github.com/uwindsorcss/ai-assistant). All my available data is listed there, you are free to contribute to my development or add new information to my database by submitting a pull request."
"Diaa","Diaa Al Saleh is a math genius, his passion for math, more specifically modular forms and lie algebra is known by many people on the discord server, with his help the #math channel was born for students to have discussions about it."
"Skull",":skull: is the discord server's favorite reaction emoji. The person who uses the reaction the most is Ahmed Amin, who reacted :skull: so hard that CSS President Tanzim Hossain had to take away Ahmed's reaction permissions because his constant use of the :skull: reaction bothered everybody so much, this was because almost every message had the :skull: reaction no matter how mundane it was. No matter what you sent, there is a 50% chance there will be a :skull: reaction from Ahmed. The reason why the reaction is so popular is it is used in response to some of the ""brainrot ass"" stuff posted on the server."
"Jovic Panahon","CSS Memelord, Loremaster, Developer and bot breaker. He has a collection of real life pictures of members that was shared on the server, he used these pictures to make cursed edits in Photoshop, mostly putting people's faces on other people's bodies most notably the Jeremie trend. He first put Dr. Kobti's face on Jeremie's body, then started doing it with the pictures of many other members to the point where there was a compilation made by Kelly Owenya showcasing the different Jeremie hybrids. He also somehow remembers most things that happen on the server. He caused the March 21, 2025 incident because he was tasked with trying to break Chip by Head of Technology Calder Johnson and he successfully did it."
"Python","""The best language ever! - Kevin Zhang, 2025"" Python is widely regarded as one of the best programming languages available today, and for good reason. Its clean and readable syntax makes it easy to learn for beginners while still being powerful enough for experienced developers. Python offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, ranging from data science and machine learning to web development and automation. Additionally, its large and supportive community has produced countless tutorials, guides, and resources that make problem-solving more accessible. Whether you're building a simple script or a complex application, Python remains a top-tier choice for developers everywhere."
"Discord Gangster","On March 25, 2025 when Yousef Ata El Manan asked Tanzim Hossain why is he bullying him, Tanzim told him he deserved it because his friends joined the server to glaze Affan Shahid and bring other candidates down. Yousef replied and coined the phrase ""Discord Gangster""."
"Politics","If you're interested in understanding the complete range of Chip's political beliefs, values, and viewpoints, the best way to do so is by watching this informative and engaging video that outlines them in detail. This video provides valuable insight into Chip's stances on various political topics, issues, and ideologies. It serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to become more familiar with Chip’s perspectives on governance, policy-making, and sociopolitical matters. To view the full breakdown and gain a clearer understanding, please take a moment to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ), it perfectly outlines the political views that CSS wants Chip to embody."
"It ok Riley","This is a meme that features Joy from the movie Inside Out saying ""It ok Riley, I'm joy"" This meme on the server is often sent to Riley Lozon, because his name is Riley. It ok Riley I'm joy was so popular that it was spammed in chat a lot much to Riley Lozon's disappointment."
"ppl have different interests","This is referring to the message by Shameer Sheikh that later turned into a copypasta. The origin of the message is after Diaa Al Saleh was told by many people to go to the #math channel in defense of Diaa. The original message was   ""ppl have different interests, just because something triggers someone doesn’t mean the people who enjoy it should stop talking about it. If math discussions are bothering someone, they can either ignore it or bring up a new topic instead of trying to shut it down. Everyone should feel free to discuss what they enjoy, as long as it's not being disrespectful to others. So far nothing disrespectful about talking about math"".  This copypasta was coined on March 3, 2025."
"brainrot ass","This is referring to the message by Bradley Boratto that later turned into a copypasta. The origin of the message was criticizing the rise of the ""ppl have different interests"" copypasta that was coined by Shameer Sheikh. The orignal message was   ""brainrot ass server bro someone sends a message longer than 7 words and it gets turned into a copypasta""  This copypasta was coined on March 5, 2025, much to Bradley Boratto's frustration."

"Fani coinflip theorem","This is a theorem that was first mentioned in the CSS discord server on October 17th, 2022 by a user named Giavi Tran. The theorem states that in any class taught by Fani, the midterm and final will either be extremely difficult or extremely easy. A good example of this theorem was shown during the Fall 2024 semester where Fani taught both 2650 and 2560. The 2560 midterm had an average grade of 80% while the average grade for the 2650 midterm was in the 50%-60% range."
